Pellet Palette Power
====================

This is a game about rainbow pegasuses (pegusi?) who shit cupcakes and fart rainbows in space. There are different colours of pegusi, and they each prefer to eat their matching colour of cupcake. This game uses the [LÃ–VE framework][1]

This was an entry in Melbourne [Global Game Jam 2012][2] organised by [IGDA Melbourne][3]
